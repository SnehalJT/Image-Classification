About Rhyme:
In Coursera's hands-on platform called Rhyme. We do projects in a hands-on manner in your browser. You will get instant access to pre-configured cloud desktops that have all the software and data we will need. So, we can just focus on the learning. For this project, this means instant access to a cloud desktop with Python, Jupyter, and TensorFlow pre-installed.
